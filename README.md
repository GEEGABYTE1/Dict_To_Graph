# Dict To Graph
Takes a dictionary and converts it into a graph.

`gen_path` will generate all possible paths and will also generate the `shortest path` between two vertices inputted. 

`create_path` will generate a path between two vertices if a path does not exist already by default. 

# Example 

- `a -> c `
- `b -> c `
- `b -> e `
- `c -> a `
- `c -> b `
- `c -> d `
- `c -> e `
- `d -> c `
- `e -> c `
- `e -> b `
